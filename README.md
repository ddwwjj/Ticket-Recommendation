# Ticket-Recommendation

### Hi there, welcome to Personal Ticket Recommendation Website.

I developed two versions of website:

* MySQL-version: 
 
  * Built on relational database MySQL to store event data retrieved from TicketMaster API.
  * Deployed server to Amazon EC2 to handle 150 queries per second tested by Apache JMeter.

* MongoDB-version:
  * Built on NoSQL databases MongoDB to improve response speed when facing large scale of requests per second.

These are only core source code, please check the running result [here](https://youtu.be/4iMDEmIGyKc).
